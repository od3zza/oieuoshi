Aquilo acontece e você sente, e esse sentimento é a verdade. Há também a contemplaí§ão, por mais que não totalmente livre para o jogador, mas em momentos onde você não faz \"\"nada produtivo\"\". Por exemplo, você não consegue explorar o mundo aberto, mas pode parar e apenas ouvir a Ellie contar piadas ou observas as girafas atravessando a cidade devastada. Não são momentos íºteis ou lógicos, mas são essenciais pois nos fazem sentir. Essa é a beleza do jogo, sua verdade subjetiva. Essas pausas te riam da aí§ão linear e te fazem respirar, sentir, pensar.
